#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

 #   summary: |
 #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm currently a postdoc at the University of East Anglia (UEA), based in the beautiful city of Norwich, working with [Prof Teodora Gliga](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/teodora-gliga) on an ESRC funded project aiming to understand how access to language may shape conceptual and cognitive development in hearing and deaf infants. You can read more about the aims of this project here. This project is conducted alongside [Dr Nadja Althaus](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/nadja-althaus), [Dr Evelyne Mercure](https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/mercure-evelyne/), from the School of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London and [Prof Marie Smith](https://cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/people/scientificstaff/marie-l-smith), from Birkbeck College, University of London.

My research is focused on early cognitive development during infancy, with a focus on conceptual and language development (including spoken and signed languages), working with hearing and deaf infants. I am interested in understanding how infants development concepts and learn words/signs that describe these concepts. My work investigates both concrete (such as objects) and abstract (such as actions and events) words and concepts, and aims to understand how access to language impacts learning. I use a range of neurocognitive and behavioural techniques including EEG (ERP/MVPA), eye-tracking, parent-child interactions, behavioural coding, and parent-report measures.
